![](translated_samples/joaquin.jpg)

Not sure if Joker face would look good on you for Halloween? Try jokeriser!

Jokeriser finds your face with <a href="https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch">facenet_pytorch</a>  and translate your face to a Joker's using a generator trained with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf">CycleGAN</a>. 

<br>

## Getting Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/junkwhinger/jokerise.git
$ cd jokeriser
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to jokerise

```bash
# image
python demo.py --input samples/joaquin.jpg

# video
python demo.py --input samples/joaquin.mp4

# webcam
python demo.py --webcam

# wanna see original & tranlsated version side by side?
python demo.py --webcam --show-original
```

<br>

### Note

- I tested my code in OSX environment. Not sure if it works well on other platforms.
